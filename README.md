## farmerjoe
Render queue system for blender (renderfarm)

Farmejoe was originally written for Blender 2.4
Development stopped as I moved on and changes to the Blender API made it difficult to maintain when I was not actively using Blender.

Recently I was contacted by a dedicated user who had got the farmejoe submit script working in blender 2.8 which has promted me to put the older version into this repository for reference.

Farmerjoe after all these years will re-emerge soon for 2.8 and live on.

### Why Another Network Rendering System? 
I originally tried many render queue managers, and while there are very good systems, they tend to be a mission to get installed and after struggling with them I figured that rather wasting anymore time trying out other systems, I would just write one that did things the way I wanted.

### How is Farmerjoe Different?
Farmerjoe is designed to have no installation - just a folder you share with everything in it. At the time I only really knew how to program in perl so wrote the whole system in Perl as a single script (for the mostpart) and also compiled it to an exe version so you dont have to install perl. Farmerjoe supported both frame based and bucket rendering.

### Nostalgia
Back in 2007 Farmerjoe was used by quite a few people and appeared in 3D world magazine and also Linux Format with articles on how to use it - Farmejoe was used in these articles as it was so easy to set up which was really great as this was the main goal I had tried to achieve.
